# JsLint Checker for Sublimt Text 2

## Installation

 1. Clone source into *Sublime Packages Folder* (`Preferences -> Browse Packages`)
 1. Change path to *jslint4java* and arguments for it in `local_settings.py`
 1. Restart Sublime

## Dependencies

JsChecker Package tested only with *jslint4java* but it should work with
other jslint execution methods like *node* or *rhino*. Tested way of execution
of JsLint is quite slow and I will rework it in future to speed up checks.

 1. [JsLint4Java](http://code.google.com/p/jslint4java/)
